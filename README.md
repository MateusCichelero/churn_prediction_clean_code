# churn_prediction_clean_code
Identification of credit card customers most likely to churn. Includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented and tested). The package also has the flexibility to run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).  It will also introduce a problem data scientists across companies face all the time: How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers who are likely to churn?
